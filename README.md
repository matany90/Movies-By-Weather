## Web application I developed using Vue.js Framework

In Matan's World you can search for movies and series, get information about them and even watch the weather forecast in your area.

Deployment link:
https://matan-movies-webapp.firebaseapp.com

Technologies I used:
- Vue.js
- Third-party API's (OMDB API, GeoIP API, Openweather API)

### OMDB API
Provides information about movies and series.

### GeoIP API
Provides information about user's location through his IP address.

### Openweather API
Provides information about Weather by City

```shell
# clone repo
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/matany90/Movies-By-Weather.git

# install dependencies
cd ./Movies-By-Weather

```
